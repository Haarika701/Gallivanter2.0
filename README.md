# What made me choose this idea?
Traveling is one of my passions and I value being well-prepared. However, I often encounter the challenge of sifting through numerous travel-related emails, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming. To address this issue, I decided to create a feature that allows me to conveniently store and access all my travel information and itineraries in one place.
  
# Reason for the project: 
As part of the final phase of our software engineering course at Flatiron School (class of 09/21), I developed a project to showcase the knowledge and skills I acquired throughout the bootcamp. The project was built using JavaScript and React functional components, which involved using React states to manage and manipulate dynamically changing events on the DOM, setting up controlled forms, and persisting data to a backend server. Additionally, I demonstrated my proficiency in building a server-side application using Ruby on Rails to manage a PostgreSQL database, define restful and non-restful routes, handle authentication and authorizations, and validate data received from the frontend. Lastly, I utilized CSS to create a visually appealing design for my web application.
  
# App Description
The Gallivanter App allows users to easily create an account by signing up or logging in. Once logged in, users can access the trip planner section to create customized itineraries. These itineraries can be viewed and deleted at any time. Additionally, signed-in users can explore nearby tourist destinations and attractions using the search function. The "things to do" feature can be sorted into attractions and activities for easier browsing. Users can also keep track of their favorite spots in the Bucket List section. 

# Goals for version 2.0 
- Building a cross-functional application using react native for iOS mobile devices.
- UI enhancements of the application.
- Deployment of the application to App Store.
- Migrating the tech stack from Ruby to Java for memory management and improved scalability.
- Using an external API such as TripAdvisor for nearby attractions.
  
# Deployment
- Currently working on it.
